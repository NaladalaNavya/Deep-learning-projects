# Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to my deep learning project repository! This repository contains several projects I have worked on, demonstrating various applications of deep learning in image processing, customer analytics, and natural language processing. Below are the details of each project:

## Projects

1. **CIFAR Image Detection**
   - **Description**: Implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which includes 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.
   - **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

2. **Customer Churn Prediction**
   - **Description**: Developed a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn (leave the service). Used customer data and applied various machine learning algorithms to improve retention strategies.
   - **Technologies**: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

3. **Handwritten Digit Prediction**
   - **Description**: Built a deep learning model using CNN to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, which includes 70,000 images of digits written by different individuals.
   - **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

4. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - **Description**: Created a natural language processing (NLP) model to analyze the sentiment of text data. The model classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
   - **Technologies**: Python, NLTK, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas

5. **Face Mask Detection**
   - **Description**: Developed a CNN model to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not from real-time video streams or images, helping to enforce health guidelines.
   - **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy
